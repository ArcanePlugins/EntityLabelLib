# EntityLabelLib

*A library to simplify working with client-side entity label modifications.*

EntityLabelLib (ELL) allows plugins to easily manipulate client-side nametags/CustomName values of
entities with support for both sending and intercepting packets. Inside, it contains

> being confused for the server-side CustomName value of a mob.
> The entire purpose of ELL is to allow plugins
> to easily modify these values strictly client-side (using packets).

## Requirements

- **Platforms required:** ELL is available for Bukkit (and therefore SpigotMC/PaperMC servers).
  - *SpongePowered and Minestom implementations are planned for the distant future.*
  
- **Adventure is required:** ELL requires you to use Adventure components,
which are available on all platforms.
  - If you are compiling your plugin purely for platforms which natively provide Adventure, then
  no worries!
  - Otherwise, for plugins which are compatible with SpigotMC and other non-Adventure
  platforms, you'll need a platform implementation shaded in, such as the Bukkit one.

- **LabelHandler Impl Compatibility:** Users must fulfil any of these requirements for ELL to work:
  - MC 1.18.2 (or newer) servers will use the `NmsLabelHandler`
  (unless a new version has not been implemented yet).
  - Servers with ProtocolLib installed will use the `ProtocolLibLabelHandler`.
  - Servers which do not fulfil any of the above requirements will not be able to use ELL, as there
  is no other label handler implementation available to provide compatibility with their server.

            EntityLabelLib was born out of LM4's necessities for packet label management.
            <br /><br />
            LM4 utilises EntityLabelLib to display per-player fake labels to display level and health information.
            <br />
            LM4 also actively displays or hides nametags per-player depending on user settings and player context.
